        <p class="white-text">I do circus. <br>It includes everything I’ve ever dreamt about. </p>
          
        <p class="white-text">I’m dreaming about worlds. These worlds are different than the one we are living in. My art is to create new places where to dive in, where to be open and vulnerable.</p>

        <p class="white-text">My art is about freedom. Freedom to choose the influences found from the worlds.</p>
          
        <p class="white-text">That’s why I make labyrinths.</p>
        <p class="white-text">Once I lost my sense of direction and found myself. I realized there is no right nor wrong ways.
        Labyrinths are performances including collaboration with different art fields. </p>

        <p class="white-text">Graduated from Turku University of Applied Sciences, performance art, circus department, 2015.</p>

        <p class="white-text">I'm in love with space and light. I'm interested in how the body, and we as complete human beings, are aware of changes in scale, darkness, brightness, sounds, materials and shapes of our surroundings. How the space we are in affects us and we affect the space.</p>
        
        <p class="white-text">I used to think my art doesn't have a theme or any underlying idea, but as I view it in retrospect I find out it kind of has. It's a manifestation of all and nothing, which I think is the essence of everything. Everything around us, even we ourselves, can be valued as all and nothing at the same time, and I believe that's where the panic of the Western society arises from. I love the thought. It drives me into a state of acceptance and gives me a feeling of ultimate freedom and ability.</p>
        
        <p class="white-text">In Recover Laboratory I'm dealing with my babies: space and light. Come to us, let's explore!</p>

          <p class="white-text">I’m a contemporary artist and an event producer. I’m the artistic director for Recover Laboratory. I’m responsible for the visual image and visual universe of the happening.</p>

          <p class="white-text">In my work I explore and love different materials and medias. The process goes on and on,  layer by layer, until it slowly starts to make sense. Suddenly everything seems quite logical and simple. My work is layered and abundant, I draw my inspiration from trying to understand art and trying to force art to take a shape through an artistic process. This is how I want to portray this hulabaloo called life. It’s ingenious in its’ simplicity. </p>

          <p class="white-text">My medias are almost anything I can get my hands on or anything that the artwork I’m working on at the moment needs to be completed. So far I have mostly worked with painting, drawing, animation, video and sculpture. Recently my work has been shown in Tampere and in Berlin, and I have an exhibition coming up in Helsinki. In the field of event producing I’ve mainly focused on independent urban festivals and electornic music events. This is my second year as a part of the Recover Crew.</p>
